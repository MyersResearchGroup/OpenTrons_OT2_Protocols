# OpenTrons_OT2_Protocols
The genetic logic lab's Opentrons protocols

Within this repository there is a collection of folders that includes both protocols and base command setups. There also includes a PDF named "How_to_OPT" which explains the basics of python and GUI based OT-2 protocol creation, how to use the OT-2 app, and how the OT-2 simulation is setup and run. 

The base command folders can be read off of and used to understand the python based OT-2 code that can run specific commands. The base commands are split by 8-channel, transfer, temperature, and thermocycler. Transfer is focused primarily on the single channel transfer commands, 8-channel is focused on the use of the 8-channel pipette tip, temperature  is focused on the base commands of the temperature module, and thermocycler is focused on the thermocycler module. 

The protocols are setup to have longer process and are seperated between tester and experiment protocols. Tester protocols were made to better understand how OPT works. While the experiment protcols are made to actually run specific parts of experiments.
